# About
Currently, the main [AugRE](https://github.com/UTNuclearRobotics/Augmented-Robot-Environment) Unreal Engine AR application and associated packages for autonomous agents are closed-source. The Unreal Engine Module, [Robotfleet Unreal Client](https://github.com/UTNuclearRoboticsPublic/RobofleetUnrealClient), however, is open source and enables users to communicate and pass ROS-based messages to and from Unreal Engine-based applications using a [robofleet server](https://github.com/UTNuclearRobotics/robofleet_server) and a [robofleet client](https://github.com/UTNuclearRobotics/robofleet_client) infrastructure.
